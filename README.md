# PowerLift AI: Clustering and Classification in Powerlifting
A machine learning project analyzing the Open Powerlifting Dataset to uncover insights into performance trends and predict categories such as weight classes using K-Means Clustering and Naïve Bayes Classification.

# Project Overview
PowerLift AI leverages AI to analyze powerlifting data, including performance metrics, lifter attributes, and competition details. The project uses machine learning techniques to:

- Group lifters into performance-based clusters using K-Means.
- Predict lifter categories (e.g., weight classes) using Naïve Bayes Classification.
- Provide insights and visualizations to better understand lifter performance.
